Extension for browsing RSS feeds of podcasts and stream the episodes.

This extension lets you browse podcasts distributed as RSS feeds and play
individual episodes in a variety of audio formats. Podcasts are mapped to
albums, while podcast episodes are shown as tracks in Mopidy, with metadata
converted to Mopidy's native data model where applicable. OPML 2.0
subscription lists and directories are also supported for multi-level
browsing.
